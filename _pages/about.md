I'm just a guy. I go by <span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(246,179,94,1) 0%, rgba(235,162,70,1) 27%, rgba(122,203,85,1) 48%, rgba(79,206,217,1) 68%, rgba(167,0,210,1) 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">Flower Shop</span> online, among other names. My favorite flower is the Calendula.

I'm a graduate of the **New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study ('23)**, where I concentrated in **Computer Science and Media Studies**. My colloquium was titled, **"Truth, Technology, and Society."** If you're a(n incoming) Gallatin student interested in tech, please don't hesitate to reach out to me by email or on LinkedIn (check the sidebar)!

I'm currently working on TBD at TBD. :)
